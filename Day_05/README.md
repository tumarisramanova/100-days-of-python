🔐 Day 05 – Password Generator

A secure password generator that creates random passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols.
You can customize how many of each character type you want — and the program shuffles them for extra security! 🧩

🧠 What I learned:

Using the random module effectively

Generating random choices from lists

Creating lists and combining them dynamically

Using loops and random.shuffle() to randomize order
