ðŸ¤– Day 06 â€“ Reeborgâ€™s World Maze Solver

A Python program that guides Reeborg the robot to find his way through a maze!
This challenge is part of the Reeborgâ€™s World interactive environment, where you write Python code to help a virtual robot reach its goal. ðŸš€

ðŸ§  What I learned:

How to use loops (while) and conditional logic

Defining and reusing functions

Controlling robot movements with move(), turn_left(), right_is_clear(), and at_goal()

Problem-solving and debugging logic-based tasks
